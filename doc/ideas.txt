Ideas:

- Discussion organized into three broad sections: Personal, Channel-based
  and Global. Global messages will simply be relayed to every single user.
  Channel-based messages will be relayed to every single user that “subscribed”
  to a given channel; and these will be encrypted with the channel's private
  key. Personal messages will be encrypted with the recipient's private key
  directly.

- Identification will be hash based. There will be no moderation, “banning” or
  join/leave notices in channels; users have the power to ignore certain hashes
  should the need arise.

- The p2p network will be based on graph theory; ideally it should be
  “self-healing” or “self-organizing”, orphan nodes will self-connect to make
  sure the graph doesn't split in two, and channel users will try to make
  paths between them as short as possible, the graph will organize to make
  heavy routing paths shorter or more efficient. Possible use of neural
  networks to memorize routing efficiency.
