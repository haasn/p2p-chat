Project goals:

- Peer to peer chat program
- Fully serverless
- Either distributed or decentralized
- Fully encrypted, based on concepts of public/private key encryption
- Anonymity will not be a strong point, but privacy will.

Check list:

- Peer to peer: Check
- Serverless: As far as reasonably possible, boot strapper nodes are somewhat
  required primarily due to network size and availability constraints
- Distributed: Check
- Fully encrypted: Not yet, but trivial
- Privacy: Check; hashes and signatures in place for verification
