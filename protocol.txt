Protocol structure:

In effort to easen debugging as well as for academic illustration, the
protocol will be largely text-based, with keywords and commands given in
English.

The protocol will be divided into two fundamental parts; the routing header
and the content. The routing header is in charge of determining where a packet
is sent, the content is in charge of transmitting information and negotiating
interactions.

A single packet will be divided into “sections”; each of these consist of a
keyword as well as multiple parameters. Sections will be separated by
newlines, with keywords/parameters being separated by spaces. A field which
needs to contain spaces, eg. as part of a message or name, will be surrounded
by NULL (0x00) characters, which will be invalid characters for any other
purposes. The protocol is to be transmitted in such a way that permits the
usage of NULL characters, eg. with length-specified carrier packets

The separation between the routing header and the content is to be done using
a completely empty section; in other words, an empty line


Routing header:

The routing header may contain the following sections:


  TARGET section:

  > TARGET <TYPE> [<ADDRESS>]

  “TYPE” may either “GLOBAL”, to indicate a global packet, “EXACT” to indicate
  a packet sent to a single destination node, or “APPROX” to indicate a
  DHT-style proximity route where the target is the /closest/ node to given
  ADDRESS.

  ADDRESS must be present if type is “EXACT” or “APPROX”, and may not be
  present if type is “GLOBAL”, and indicates the recipient of the packet.

  Examples:

  > TARGET GLOBAL
  > TARGET EXACT 0.784
  > TARGET APPROX 0.321


  SOURCE section:

  > SOURCE <HASH> <SIGNATURE>

  “HASH” must be the identifying hash of the packet's original sender.
  Signature must be a cryptographic signature that can be verified using HASH,
  encoded using base 64.

  Examples:

  > SOURCE 3f1f10b8d7 VGEtZGFhIQ==


  SOURCEADDR section:

  > SOURCEADDR <ADDRESS>

  “ADDRESS” corresponds to the original sender's address. This section is
  entirely optional, and serves mainly to speed up negotiatons. However, it is
  to be noted that it can not necessarily be trusted. If it is missing, the
  return address will instead be queried from the DHT.

  Examples:

  > SOURCEADDR 0.513


The routing header must adhere to the following rules:

- The TARGET section must be present.
- The SOURCE section must be present.
- SIGNATURE must verify with HASH.

Any packets not complying with these restrictions shall be discarded
immediately and without further notice.
